# Restart: the open React framework

Restart is a *minimal* and fully transparent React full-stack framework. All the code for Restart is fully accessible in the template and you can modify it as well.

Restart relly on some cool tech to work:
1. [Bun](https://bun.sh): bundler and runtime
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): the cooler and safer JavaScript
3. [tRPC](https://trpc.io): expose type-safe backend functions to the frontend
4. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): make css writing way easier
5. [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/): easy state-management solution for React
